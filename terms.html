    <h1>VolvoUWBUnlock - Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>VolvoUWBUnlock is a personal research application developed by the vehicle owner as part of a personal AI agent (LLM-based) research project. The application uses a personal UWB (Ultra-Wideband) accessory and the owner's iPhone to detect proximity to the vehicle, triggering a workflow that calls the Volvo Cars Connected Vehicle API to unlock or lock the vehicle.</p>
    <p>The UWB proximity detection is independent from the vehicle's own systems and does not connect to or interact with the car's hardware.</p>

    <h2>2. Personal Use</h2>
    <p>This application is intended solely for personal use by the vehicle owner. It is not distributed to or intended for use by third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Handling</h2>
    <p>All vehicle data obtained through the Volvo Cars Connected Vehicle API (including door/lock status and location) is stored exclusively on the owner's device. No data is collected, transmitted to external servers, or shared with any third party.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This application interacts with the Volvo Cars Connected Vehicle API and Location API, which are subject to their own terms and conditions as published by Volvo Car Corporation on the Volvo Cars Developer Portal.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This application is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The developer assumes no liability for any issues, damages, or losses arising from the use of this application, including but not limited to vehicle access failures or API unavailability.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes</h2>
    <p>These terms may be updated at any time. The latest version will always be available at this URL.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions regarding this application, contact the developer at matteogrella@gmail.com.</p>
